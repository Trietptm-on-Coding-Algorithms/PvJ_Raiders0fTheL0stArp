Beacon Info
==============

A lot of this is cursory information I've been trying to put together by skimming through the Scorebot source code.

Interesting Finds
------------

* `http://www.prosversusjoes.net:8090/beacons` - Noted in `SBE-2.5-Old/jscript/scoreboard.js`

    Obviously this may be old, though -- hence the directory name...


*  `http://192.168.1.12:8000/api/beacon/active` - Noted in `CLI_BEACON_SERVER/beacon-monitor/app/app.py`

    This may be interesting, but note that it is a local IP address. Perhaps something that only runs during the game There seem to be a lot of interesting API calls. `/api/beacon/port`... may just need a _*token*_. 

* `MVN{129d34896880d6377d2ef473e12bea30}` - Noted in `CLI_BEACON_SERBER/beacon-monitor/static/flag`

    Looks to be "MVN" for "Maven Blog"... "C.A.R.E search" is noted in the templates. C may refer to Compromise??
